# React Router v6 Unexpected Routing Behavior
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6 with dynamic route segments or nested routes.  The problem often manifests as unexpected page rendering or incorrect component display during navigation.

## Problem Description
The `bug.js` file contains a simplified React application using React Router v6.  Under certain navigation scenarios, the application might not correctly switch between routes or might render the wrong components. This is often caused by improper use of route parameters, nested routes, or a misunderstanding of how React Router v6 handles component rendering and updates.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the application. The solution addresses the unexpected routing behavior by carefully handling route parameters, implementing nested routes correctly, or ensuring that component updates are managed effectively.  Common fixes include using `useParams` correctly, resolving path conflicts, or ensuring the proper rendering of fallback components.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate between the different routes to observe the unexpected routing behavior in the original `bug.js` file.  Then compare the results to the corrected version in `bugSolution.js`.
